WIP: 
* Ran into some problems (possibly xcode-related?) with the UserDefault settings, and was unable to finish in time :-( 
* I'm afraid I misunderstood the instructions, in that I took the user stories (listed under Step 6) to be optional. That's why I only implemented some (layout/formatting improvements, persisting keyboard visibility) and not others (localized currency, etc.)


Notes:
* Optimized for iPhone 7
* Outstanding work/improvements commented as 'TODO'
